(3) Name of the competing planner(s):

DAE_YAHSP


(4) DAE_YAHSP
 
(4.1) Tracks of the competition into which the planner is entered

    [X] Sequential, satisficing
    [ ] Sequential, optimization
    [X] Sequential, multi-core
    [ ] Sequential, agile
    [X] Temporal, satisficing
    [ ] Temporal, optimization
    [ ] Preferences, satisficing
    [ ] Preferences, optimization


If you have comments about tracks that are only partially supported by
your planner (e.g., the planner does not support negative preconditions
or ADL), please indicate them here:

The planner does not natively support negative preconditions and conditional effects and will rely on pre-compilation.

The planner does not support ADL and derived predicates.


(4.2) The competition machine will run Linux. Please specify the
programming language(s), compilers and other auxiliary software (e.g.
CPLEX) required by the planner:

GMP
OpenMPI


(4.3) Particular aspects of the planner that are important to running
the experiments

    [X] The planner uses randomized algorithms
    [X] The planner is incremental/anytime


Additional particular aspects about your planner you want to let us know
about:

The planners would be able to participate to a "temporal, satisficing,
multi-core" track, if it was of some interest.


STATEMENT: We agree that the final version of the source code of our
planner that will participate the competition, will be made publicly
available through the official IPC-2014 web site.
